          <ul>
            <li>LOOK - robot will scan and describe surroundings</li>
            <li>GET [something] - robot will pick up an item. The robot figures out how on it's own</li>
            <li>GO [direction] - robot navigates using ship directions, port, starboard, etc</li>
            <li>OPEN [something] - I think there is programming in the robot to check if this makes sense first?</li>
            <li>INVENTORY - Makes robot list what it's holding. Can just use I</li>
            <li>USE [something] ON [something] - Complex object interactions. How does the robot know what to do?? Does it just guess??</li>
          </ul>

        <div>There were other commands but the instructor didn't list them all. Thankfully the robot has the HELP command which lists all the different actions it can perform.</div>
